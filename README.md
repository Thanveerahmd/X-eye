Mobile App to control HC-05 bluetooth
Level 1 Hardware project Automated Snellan Chart.
Developed a hardware system to automate the process of eye checking which is still done by a medical officer.
The eye checking chart (Snellan chart) is capable of moving toward the patient according to patientâ€™s command and calculate the distance it travelled.
Then it communicate with a mobile device and send the calculated lense power. 
The technology is based on Micro-Controllers (Atmega32) including a Bluetooth and IR sensor.
This repository contains the code for the Ionic-based mobile application developed to communicate with the HC-05 bluetooth controller.
The application includes a user interface for controlling the robot and viewing the results communicated to the mobile device.
